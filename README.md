# The Emoji Game

URL: https://emoji-game-voss.web.app/welcome

There are many trivia games out there and it seems as though every type of trivia has been done before. We intend to introduce a unique form of trivia. Instead guessing questions from words, the user will guess based off of emojis. There will be multiple emojis on the screen that, when read together, represent a familiar word or phrase. For example if the user were given, 🌮 🔔 they would have to type in the phrase “Taco Bell”. There will be three different modes for this game: easy, hard, and movies. Each entry in our Firestore database will have the following attributes: question (string of emojis) and answer (string). There will be different collections storing different types of questions. Some examples of these collections include easy, hard, movies, and bible.  The user will have three lives, indicated by three hearts at the top of the screen. Each time the user guesses a question wrong, they lose a heart. When the user loses all three hearts, they get taken to the game over screen, which displays the number of questions they answered correctly before losing. We also provide hints, which the user may purchase to get help on a question. These hints require coins, which are earned from answering a question correctly. We may use custom components to display different parts of the game, such as the lives area, the question area, and the input area.
